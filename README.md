Technical Features:

- Zero external dependencies (SQLite3 included with source code)
- Single binary executable
- Fast C implementation
- Cross-platform compatibility

- Local-only data storage (no cloud sync)
- No configuration files or setup required

## Installation

### Build

To build `remembrall`, all you need is a C compiler...  

**NOTE**: First time building `remembrall` will take a little bit of time due to compiling `sqlite3.o`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/navazjm/remembrall
```

```sh
cd remembrall
```

#### POSIX

```sh
cc ./build/nob.c -o ./build/nob
```

```sh
./build/nob --install
```

#### Windows (MinGW/GCC)

```sh
gcc ./build/nob.c -o ./build/nob
```

```sh
build\nob.exe --install
```

#### Windows (MSVC)

```sh
cl ./build/nob.c /Fe:./build/nob.exe /Fo:./build/nob.obj
```

```sh
build\nob.exe --install
```

**IMPORTANT**: Windows users will need to manually add "%APPDATA%\rmbrl" to their PATH.

## Usage

**NOTE**: Flags support both `--flag value` and `--flag=value` syntax.

### Commands
| Command | Flags                | Description |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| `add`   | `--project`          | Add memory to your collection    |
| `peek`  | `--all`, `--project` | Show what you're currently remembering  |
| `clear` | `--all`, `--project` | Forget memories |

### Command Flags
| Flag        | Short | Supported Commands     | Description |
|-------------|-------|------------------------|-------------|
| `--project` | `-p`  | `add`, `peek`, `clear` | Tag and filter memories by project name |
| `--all`     | `-a`  | `peek`, `clear`        | Apply operation to all memories |

### Global Flags

| Flag        | Short | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `--help`    | `-h`  | Show help information |
| `--version` | `-V`  | Show version information |
| `--verbose` | `-v`  | Enable verbose output |
| `--silent`  | `-s`  | Enable silent mode |
| `--dry-run` | `-n`  | Perform dry run without making changes |

### Examples

- Add memory to your collection

```sh
rmbrl add "task description"
```

- Show most recent memory

```sh
rmbrl peek
```

- Show all memories

```sh
rmbrl peek --all
```

- Forget most recent memory

```sh
rmbrl clear
```

- Forget all memories

```sh
rmbrl clear --all
```

#### Project Flag Examples

Can think of this like adding a tag to easily filter tasks by project.

```sh
rmbrl add --project lazypm "refactor filter proc"
```

```sh
rmbrl peek --project lazypm
```

```sh
rmbrl peek --all --project lazypm
```

```sh
rmbrl clear --project lazypm --all
```

## Database Location

`remembrall` stores its database file (`rmbrl.db`) in the standard application data
directory for your operating system

**NOTE**: The directory will be created automatically when you first run `remembrall`.
You can backup your data by copying the `rmbrl.db` file, or migrate to a new system by placing
your backup in the appropriate location.

### Windows

`%APPDATA%\rmbrl\rmbrl.db`

Example: `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\rmbrl\rmbrl.db`

### macOS

`~/Library/Application Support/rmbrl/rmbrl.db`

Example: `/Users/YourName/Library/Application Support/rmbrl/rmbrl.db`

### Linux

`~/.local/share/rmbrl/rmbrl.db`

Example: `/home/YourName/.local/share/rmbrl/rmbrl.db`
